This questionnaire uses Qualtrics. The University of Amsterdam (UvA) is committed to protecting your privacy. The University of Amsterdam has a privacy statement, which can be read here.



The objective of this questionnaire/study is to collect information for The Data Science of Everyday Music Listening, a seminar for honours students at the University of Amsterdam.



Questionnaire



The purpose of the questionnaire is to assess the effects of listening to music on reading comprehension.



You are being asked to complete two short reading tasks, after which you will be asked to answer 4 multiple choice questions about the given passages. You will have to listen to some background music while reading one of the two passages. The music will play automatically for one of the two passages you will be shown, as soon as you start reading.



Confidentiality
